Came across the game this morning and quit it this evening: 


Load this extension on chrome and you're good to go.

## How does it work
The game loads a file generally called ```game.js```. We abuse the powers of the local user to use our altered version of ```game.js``` which patches certain functions. For example we can have name esp (see players through walls) by removing a simple team check during a render loop to show player cards: ```if (!tmpObj.inView) continue;```

## Anti cheat
Their "anti script" is mainly the last few lines of the js file ```zip.js```. Any script that is loaded with a source from ```jsdelivr``` or ```raw.githack.com``` gets flagged. This is easy to avoid if need be.

```
setInterval(function() {
    document.querySelectorAll("script[src*='jsdelivr'], script[src*='raw.githack.com']").length && (document.body.innerHTML = "<div style='font-size:28px;margin-top:30px;width:100%;text-align:center'>SCRIPT DETECTED</div>")
}, 1E4);
```


The anti script also checks if certain classes are defined under the ```window``` object:

```
window.chH = function(a) {
    try {
        null == window.hack && null == window.iUb && null == window.hags && null == window.aimbot && null == window.nxtrun && null == window.KrunkAimDotTK && null == window.wallHackEnabled || !a.socket || (a.send("hc"), a.socket.close())
    } catch (b) {}
};
```

In an attempt to avoid updates which could potentially blacklist this cheat, this extension blocks all javascript files from krunker.io. 


Krunkers client side javascript code allows for remote code execution via their WebSockets. Here are some examples of the use of their remote code execution to check if a client has loaded properly:

```Array.from(document.scripts).filter(x=>x.src&&/js\/game\.[^\.]+\.js\?build=.+/.test(x.src)).length?'checkin':'loadin'```

and 

```document.querySelector("script[src*='js/game']")?'load':'loadin',false```


Remote code execution could allow for a stealthy anti cheat check to be loaded mid game going unnoticed by a typical cheater. This extension completley disables remote code execution and alerts the user if they are trying to execute something new so that they cannot place an anti cheat system in stealth.

If krunker.io wants some help in the cat game I'm down to give up the mouse game.
